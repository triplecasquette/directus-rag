- Earlier this year we committed to providing security updates to Directus 10 until the end of the year, make sure you upgrade to 10.13.4 if you’re still on the version 10 family. The same patch has been included in the Directus 11 patch as well.

## November 2024
- In [Directus 11.1.2](https://github.com/directus/directus/releases/tag/v11.1.2), improvements to content versioning and new comment endpoints have been made.
    - For improvements to content versioning, internally, we stored every change to a content version separately in the `directus_revisions` collection, and then merged them together when promoting a version. In this release, we’ve added a new `delta` field to the `directus_versions` collection that combines all revisions into a single field. This means you can prune `directus_revisions` without compromising your content versions.
     - We've introduced a dedicated `directus_comments` collection, replacing the previous system that used `directus_activity` for comments. While new comment endpoints have been added, existing endpoints remain functional. Comment primary keys are now UUIDs instead of numeric values, which may impact custom type checking implementations. The SDK's internal comment endpoints have been updated to reflect this change. To avoid errors, ensure your Directus version is compatible with the latest SDK when using comment functions.
- In [Directus 11.2.0](https://github.com/directus/directus/releases/tag/v11.2.0), TUS (resumable uploads) now added to Supabase, Azure, Cloudinary, and GCS storage adapters to join AWS and Local Adapters released in 10.13.0.
- The [AI Web Scraper](https://github.com/directus-labs/extensions/tree/main/packages/ai-web-scraper-operation) allows you to scrape web pages and receive structured data back using Firecrawl's web scraping API to extract data from websites.
- The [AI Writer](https://github.com/directus-labs/extensions/tree/main/packages/ai-writer-operation) has been extended to include the option to use multiple AI providers as well as different models.
- The [Tree Map Chart](https://github.com/directus-labs/extensions/tree/main/packages/treemap-chart-panel) presents a cluster or boxes where the size of each box represent the value. You can also group data into categories which are presented in different colors.
- The [Funnel Chart](https://github.com/directus-labs/extensions/tree/main/packages/funnel-chart-panel) presents a list of numbers in an ascending or descending funnel chart.
- The [Scatter Plot Chart](https://github.com/directus-labs/extensions/tree/main/packages/scatter-plot-panel) is a 2-axis chart where values are plotted as dots. You can optionally add axis labels and hover over any of the dots to see the values.
- The [Timeline Chart](https://github.com/directus-labs/extensions/tree/main/packages/timeline-chart-panel) presents a series of tasks or events with a start and end date on a graph. You can also group data into categories on the y axis and seperate tasks into different colors.
- The [Customizable Tabular Layout Boilerplate](https://github.com/directus-labs/extensions/tree/main/boilerplates/tabular-layout) give extension authors the ability to use it as a base for their customizations.

## October 2024

- The [Gantt Chart Layout](https://github.com/directus-labs/extensions/tree/main/packages/gantt-chart-layout) displays items in a collection in a gantt chart, helping those of you who use Directus for project management and task management. You can specify a label that you want displayed on each task, a start date and an end date and optionally, a dependency field which will draw dependency lines in a chart, and also specify the zoom in as granular as an hour and as broad as a year.
- The [Calculated Field Interface](https://github.com/directus-labs/extensions/tree/main/packages/calculated-fields-bundle) allows you to write a formula and the value of the interface will be automatically computed and shown. It supports the full set of functions provided by Formula.js, and a majority of JavaScript operators that work for numbers and strings. It also supports relational fields and we parse formulas to ensure they are only running allowed functions which is important for security. Important to note, values here are only visible in the interface and not in API responses.
- The [API Metric Panel](https://github.com/directus-labs/extensions/tree/main/packages/api-metric-panel) can be used to display a value from an external API. For example, the number of docker downloads or sales or followers on social media platforms. You can make a web request to get your preferred metrics, you can also provide custom headers or a request body if required, then specify the path of the value you want to display.
