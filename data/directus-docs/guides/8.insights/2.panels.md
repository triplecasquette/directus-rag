Panels are the building-blocks you can add onto insights dashboards to create, save and display data analytics. 

## Panel Header Options

![Panel Header Options](/img/302565f0-f359-4d89-afe6-73992d412a97.webp)

All panel types let you set custom text to provide quick and clear context about what a panel represents. Panel header
options are exactly the same for all four panel types. Headers are also totally optional and can be hidden.

- **Visible** – Determines if the header is visible or not.
- **Name** – Sets a name in the header area.
- **Icon** – Sets a small icon by the name.
- **Color** – Sets a color for the icon.
- **Note** – Sets a short description of the icon.

## Labels

![Label Panel Options](/img/6da43448-fe0e-4927-b428-fd675a31969a.webp)

This panel allows you to label a group of other panels. Labels do not provide analytics.
Labels essentially help visually group the other panels and give context to your dashboard.

- **Label** – Sets the label text.
- **Color** – Sets the label text color.

## Lists

![List Panel Options](/img/a32da273-f9f5-4155-bbb0-d16029cbd42e.webp)

List panels display some number of items from a collection. These items displayed can be filtered by other
criteria as well. 

- **Collection** – Selects the collection to rank.
- **Limit** – Limits the number of items that will appear in the dashboard.
- **Sort Field** – Sets the collection field you wish to order results by.
- **Sort Direction** – Sets items to display in ascending or descending order.
- **Display Template** – Defines how list items will be represented. Allows use of field item values as well as custom
  text.
- **Filter** – Sets filters to only consider and rank Items that meet some criteria.

## Metrics

![Metrics Panel Options](/img/cc4f786f-bfb2-4723-b416-9153681686d3.webp)

Metrics panels allow you to aggregate all items in a field down to a single value.

- **Collection** – Selects the collection.
- **Field** – Selects the field to run aggregate function on.
- **Aggregate Function** – Selects the type of aggregate to perform.
- **Sort Field** – Sets the collection field you wish to order results by.
- **Filter** – Sets filters to only run metrics on items that meet some criteria.

### More on Aggregate Functions

Aggregate functions take a list of values and returns one single value.

- **Count** – Counts the number of items in a field.
- **Count (Distinct)** – Counts the number of unique items in a field.
- **Average** – Averages values of all items in a field.
- **Average (Distinct)** – Averages values of all unique items in a field.
- **Sum** – Sums the values of all items in a field.
- **Sum (Distinct)** – Sums the values of all unique items in a field.
- **Minimum** – Selects the lowest valued item in a field.
- **Maximum** – Selects the highest valued item in a field.
- **First** – Selects the first item out of all items in a field.
- **Last** – Selects the last item out of all items in a field.

::callout{icon="material-symbols:info-outline"}
**First, Last, Minimum and Maximum**  
First, last, minimum and maximum are not aggregates in the purely mathematical sense of the word. However, they are
placed in this panel option because they return one single item.
::

::callout{icon="material-symbols:info-outline"}
**Why are some Fields grayed out?**  
Certain fields cannot be used with certain aggregate functions. For example, you cannot use the average function on
fields that store text, because text cannot be averaged. When there is a conflict between panel options, fields will be
grayed out and unselectable in the `field dropdown list`.
::

### Style and Format Options

- **Abbreviate Value** – Abbreviates large numbers with a letter _(e.g. 2,000 = 2K)_.
- **Decimals** – Changes the number of decimals displayed.
- **Prefix** – Adds text before the aggregate metric.
- **Suffix** – Adds text after the aggregate metric.
- **Conditional Styles** – Changes color of number displayed if it is `>`, `>=`, `<`, `<=`, `==`, or `!=` to some
  defined value.

## Time Series

**Time-oriented metrics only**  
In order to use this panel, your collection will need a datetime field.
::

::callout{icon="material-symbols:info-outline"}
**Custom Date Range**  
Note that `Past` is not prefixed to a custom range as it is on the default ranges. When selecting "Other",
type in `3 years`, `1 month`, `2 weeks`, `5 days`, etc.

## Global Variable

![Global Variables Panel Options](/img/2ff69b64-fbc8-4932-8749-17c1d2d5ac8b.webp)

- **Variable Key** — Sets your variable. Use this key to access the variable in other insights panels.
- **Type** — Sets the data type of your variable.
- **Default Value** — Sets a default value for the global variable.
- **Interface** — Selects the interface to be used.
- **Options** — Sets the interface Options.

This panel allows you to create a variable which is globally accessible across other panels. You can use this to do
things like create a string or number to prefix other insights panel titles or pass it as a value into a filter to query
results.

To assign a global variable, wrap the variable key in double-moustache syntax to access and assign it throughout other Insights
Panels:

```
{{ your_variable_key }}
```

You will notice that the global variable panel is an interface in the Dashboard, allowing you to modify the value of
this variable. If you change its value, all panels referencing the variable will update automatically.

::callout{icon="material-symbols:warning-rounded" color="amber"}
**Must be Valid Data Type**  
Your variable's data type will need to be a valid match to wherever you are using it. For example, do not apply a string
or JSON variable in a place that requires datetime data.
::

## Global Relational Variable

- **Variable Key** — Sets your variable. Use this key to access the variable in other insights panels.
- **Collection** — The collection to get the item IDs from.
- **Multiple** — Allow selection of multiple items when enabled.
- **Limit** — Limits the number of items that can be selected.
- **Display Template** — Defines how the items will be represented. Allows use of field item values as well as custom
  text.
- **Filter** — Sets filters to allow selection of items that meet some criteria.

This panel allows you to create a variable which is globally accessible across other panels. You can use this to do
things like select single or multiple items and pass their IDs as a value into a filter to query results.

To assign a global relational variable, wrap the variable key in double-moustache syntax to access and assign it throughout
other insights panels:

```
{{ your_variable_key }}
```

You will notice that the global relational variable panel is an interface in the Dashboard, allowing you to modify the
value of this variable. If you change its value, all panels referencing the variable will update automatically.

::callout{icon="material-symbols:info-outline"}
If you have multiple global relational variables in your dashboard and want to include them in a filter, use the 'one of' comparisons. For example, if you have two global variables `A` and `B` referring to `post` IDs, you can use filter `Name is one of {{A}}, {{B}}`.
::


::callout{icon="material-symbols:warning-rounded" color="amber"}
**Must be Valid Data Type**  
Your variable's data type will need to be a valid match to wherever you are using it. For example, do not apply a string
or JSON variable in a place that requires datetime data.
