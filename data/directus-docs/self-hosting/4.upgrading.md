We release a new version of Directus approximately once a month, with more rapid releases for critical fixes. 

## Breaking Changes

Each release, we update the [list of breaking changes](/releases/breaking-changes) with any changes that could affect you if upgrading. It is critically important that you review this list before upgrading, mitigating any potential issues.

Certain features may be removed, or the behavior of existing features may change. We do our best to ensure these changes are not disruptive, but they can happen. 

Changes could include:
- Changes to environment variables.
- Changes to the REST and GraphQL APIs.
- Changes to the JavaScript SDK.
- Changes to internal services used by extension authors.

## Upgrading

If using Docker, you can upgrade by updating the tag in `docker-compose.yml` or `Dockerfile`. If using `latest`, restart your container. 

All database migrations are handled automatically.
