We release new versions of Directus approximately once a month. While we provide a single version number for each release, Directus has several packages and each package may have different version numbers.

While we use a three number versioning scheme, we don't adhere to semantic versioning stadards, which means that any release may include breaking changes. Instead, we use the importance or impact of changes to determine the version number.
