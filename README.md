# 📚 # Open source and Local RAG - Retrieval-Augmented Generation

A local, open-source Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system integrated with Mardown Doc. Ask questions in natural language and get contextual, documentation-grounded answers—entirely on your own infrastructure.

---

## 🚀 Features

- **Local-first**: All models (LLM & embeddings) run locally via [Ollama](https://ollama.com/)
- **Fast semantic search**: Uses [Qdrant](https://qdrant.tech/) as a vector database
- **Markdown-native**: Indexes the official Directus documentation (`.md` files)
- **Nuxt Frontend**: Modern, minimal chat interface
- **Modular architecture**: Easily swap out models or storage
- **Testable**: All core logic is covered by isolated tests

---

## 🧬 How It Works (Pipeline)

1. **User asks a question** in the chat interface
2. **Relevance check**: The system uses a local LLM to verify if the question is about Directus
3. **Embedding**: If relevant, the question is embedded into a vector (`bge-m3` via Ollama)
4. **Semantic search**: The vector is compared to all documentation chunks in Qdrant
5. **(Planned) Rerank**: Chunks are reranked for even better relevance
6. **Prompt building**: The most relevant chunks are formatted into a prompt
7. **LLM answer**: The prompt is sent to the local LLM (Dolphin3), which generates a contextual answer
8. **Display**: The answer is shown to the user, optionally with source references

## ⚡️ Quickstart

### Prerequisites
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v18+ recommended)
- [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/) or npm/yarn
- [Ollama](https://ollama.com/) (for local LLM & embedding models)
- [Qdrant](https://qdrant.tech/) (vector database, can run via Docker)

### 1. Clone the repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-org/rag-directus.git
cd rag-directus
```

### 2. Install dependencies
```bash
pnpm install
# or
npm install
```

### 3. Start Qdrant (Docker example)
```bash
docker run -p 6333:6333 -p 6334:6334 qdrant/qdrant
```

### 4. Start Ollama and pull required models
```bash
ollama serve
ollama pull bge-m3
ollama pull dolphin3
```

### 5. Configure environment variables
Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and adjust as needed (Qdrant URL, Ollama endpoints, etc).

For guidance on extending and using additional environment variables, see the [Contributing](#-contributing) section below.

### 6. Index the documentation
```bash
pnpm index:all
```

### 7. Run the Nuxt app
```bash
pnpm dev
# or
npm run dev
```

## 🧪 Testing

All business logic is covered by isolated tests:
- `01-chunking.test.ts` → checks splitting
- `02-embedding.test.ts` → checks embedding call to Ollama
- `03-qdrant.test.ts` → checks Qdrant vector store integration
- `04-index.test.ts` → checks full indexing pipeline
- `05-search.test.ts` → checks search functionality
- `06-generation.test.ts` → checks LLM generation pipeline

> Note: It is recommended to add real end-to-end and integration tests in the future to ensure the robustness of the entire pipeline.

Run tests and scripts individually:

```bash
# Run chunking tests
pnpm test:chunk

# Run embedding tests
pnpm test:embed

# Run Qdrant vector store tests
pnpm test:qdrant

# Run full indexing pipeline tests
pnpm test:index

# Run semantic search tests
pnpm test:search

# Run LLM generation tests
pnpm test:generate

# Utility: Clear all vectors in Qdrant
pnpm clear:qdrant

# Utility: Index all documentation (run after updating docs)
pnpm index:all
```

## 🛣️ Roadmap (MVP & Beyond)

See [`ROADMAP_RAG_DIRECTUS.md`](./ROADMAP_RAG_DIRECTUS.md) for the full technical roadmap.

- [x] Local chunking & embedding
- [x] Qdrant vector store integration
- [x] Minimalist Nuxt chat interface
- [ ] More focused documentation, less volume – to be challenged

## 🤝 Contributing

This project is designed to be **modular and extensible**. Contributors are encouraged to add new:
- **Chunkers** (for different document formats or splitting strategies)
- **Embedders** (for alternative embedding models or providers)
- **Vector stores** (for other vector database backends)
- **And any other improvements** that can make the project more powerful and usable for a wider audience

Feel free to open issues or pull requests for improvements, bugfixes, or new features!
