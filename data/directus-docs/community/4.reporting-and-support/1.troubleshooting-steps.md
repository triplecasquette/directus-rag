If you're experiencing issues or think you have found a problem in Directus, be sure to follow these steps before [reporting a bug](/community/reporting-and-support/bug-reporting):

1. Ensure your server and database meet the [minimum requirements](/self-hosting/requirements).
2. Ensure you’re on the [latest version](https://github.com/directus/directus/releases/latest) of Directus.
3. Restart your Docker container. 
4. Disable any data-caching within your project.
5. Test any app issues with both browser extensions and caching disabled *(i.e. Incognito Mode)*.
6. Confirm the issue is not related to your own custom code.
7. Check for [existing issues](https://github.com/directus/directus/issues?q=is%3Aissue) (and [discussions](https://github.com/directus/directus/discussions)) that match your problem.

We highly recommend, and will only be able to help, users who run Directus with Docker. Docker removes many environment-specific problems such as system dependencies. 

If you're still experiencing a problem after completing the above steps, you can chat through things on our [community support](/community/reporting-and-support/customer-support) or [report a bug](/community/reporting-and-support/bug-reporting).
