## Community Maintenance

Unlike our main GitHub organization, repos within Directus Labs may not be actively maintained by the core team. Some will be maintained as-and-when there is requirement, demand, and time. Some are community-maintained. 

If you see a repository in the Directus Labs organization that hasn’t been updated in a while and would like to contribute to maintaining it, please reach out to the core team.
