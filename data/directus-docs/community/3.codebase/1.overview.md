The :icon{name="simple-icons:github"} [directus/directus](https://github.com/directus/directus) repository includes the Data Studio, Directus Connect, the JavaScript SDK, and a number of smaller packages used internally. All of these live in a single monorepo.

## Data Studio

This contains the Directus Data Studio App, written in Vue.js 3. `/app/public` contains assets that are included with the app, but not bundled.  The source code is located in `/app/src` with the following directories:

| Directory         | Content                                                                                                                                                      |
| -------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `/assets`      | Files that are included within the app. Are bundled and optimized in the build step.                                                                           |
| `/components`  | (Base) components that are used across the platform. Contains "basic building blocks" like button, input, etc.                                               |
| `/composables` | Reusable parts of reactive logic that can be used between Vue components. Includes things reactively calculating time from now, fetching a single item, etc. |
| `/directives`  | Custom Vue directives (e.g. `v-tooltip`).                                                                                                                    |
| `/displays`    | Components to display single pieces of data within the app.                                                                                                                |
| `/interfaces`  | The core-included interfaces that allow editing and viewing individual pieces of data.                                                                       |
| `/lang`        | Translations abstraction, and language files. The language yaml files are maintained through [Crowdin](https://locales.directus.io).                         |
| `/layouts`     | The core-included layouts that change the way items are represented inside the collection view.                                                               |
| `/modules`     | The core-included modules that structure major parts of the app.                                                                                                |
| `/operations`  | Operations are steps in a flow.                                                                                                                               |
| `/panels`      | Panels display data in the insight dashboards.                                                                                                                |
| `/routes`      | The routes in the app. Modules define their own routes, so this only includes the "system" things that don't belong to the module, like login.                   |
| `/stores`      | [Pinia](https://pinia.esm.dev) based stores used for global state tracking.                                                                                  |
| `/styles`      | All general styles, CSS variables, mixins and themes are stored inside here. Every component has their own component styles, these are just the global styles.    |
| `/types`       | TypeScript types that are shared between the different parts of the App.                                                                                     |
| `/utils`       | Utility functions used in various parts of the app.                                                                                                          |
| `/views`       | The (two) main views used in the app: public / private. Also contains "internal" coupled components for those two views.                                     |

Directus ships with a [UI Library](/guides/extensions/app-extensions/ui-library) that you can use in [app extensions](/guides/extensions/app-extensions).

## Directus Connect

This directory contains the Directus REST and GraphQL APIs written in Node.js. The source code is located in `/api/src`.

| Directory         | Content                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| -------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `/cli`         | The CLI commands and matching functions that the `directus` package ships with.                                                                                                                 |
| `/controllers` | Route handler controllers for the endpoints in the API.                                                                                                                                         |
| `/database`    | Database manipulation abstraction, system migrations, and system data. Also where you'd find the main query runner.                                                                             |
| `/errors`      | Classes for the different errors the API is expected to throw. Used to set the HTTP status and error codes.                                                                                     |

| `/services`    | Internal services. The main abstraction for interfacing with the data in the database. Both GraphQL and REST requests are "translated" to use these services as the main logic in the platform. |
| `/types`       | TypeScript types that are shared between the different parts of the API.                                                                                                                        |
