description: Learn to upload files to Directus via both the data studio or API.
---

Multiple files can be uploaded simultaneously via both the data studio and via the API. File uploads are not limited to just images, they can be any kind of file.

## Data Studio

![The files module with a number of files visible in a gallery layout.](/img/796eb265-bce2-4faa-93d0-118dac406457.webp)

By opening the files module on the left, you will see your file library, which acts as one big folder to store all uploaded files and sub-folders.

Create a folder called `Images` and click on :icon{name="material-symbols:add-circle-outline-rounded"}.

![The popup that appears when clicking on the upload button.](/img/ec81bb5c-6dbf-4518-8684-0e5df99de013.webp)

You'll see a popup with options for uploading your file:

- Dragging a file from your desktop.
- Clicking on the popup area to select a file from your machine.
- Clicking on the menu in the popup and selecting "**Import from URL**"

Optionally, you can also click the file display to open the file details page and fill in information as desired.

## API

::code-group
```http [REST]
// POST /files

Body must be formatted as a `multipart/form-data` with a final property called `file`.
```

```graphql [GraphQL]
# Not supported by GraphQL
```

```js [SDK]
import { createDirectus, rest, uploadFiles } from '@directus/sdk';

const directus = createDirectus('https://directus.example.com').with(rest());

const formData = new FormData();
formData.append('file_1_property', 'Value');
formData.append('file', raw_file);
formData.append('file_2_property', 'Value');
formData.append('file', raw_file_2);

const result = await directus.request(uploadFiles(formData));
```

::

The file contents has to be provided in a property called `file`. All other properties of
the file object can be provided as well, except `filename_disk` and `filename_download`.
