You can change between the different [cloud project tiers](/cloud/getting-started/introduction) from the Cloud Dashboard.

To change your project tier, navigate to "Projects" and click on :icon{name="material-symbols:edit"} next to the project for which you wish to change its tier. Scroll down to find the list of tiers. Once selected, you can click on "Make Changes" to confirm.

In order to change to an enterprise project, please [contact us](https://directus.io/contact).
