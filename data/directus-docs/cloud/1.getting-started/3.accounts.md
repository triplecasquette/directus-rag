title: Managing Cloud Accounts
description: An account is your portal to Directus Cloud. You can use it to manage your teams, team members, projects and billing.

To avoid confusion, "user" is the term for user profiles in a Directus Project, while the terms "account" and "team
member" are used in the context of Directus Cloud. Accounts on Directus Cloud and Users in a Directus Project are
two separate systems.

## Create Account and Login
