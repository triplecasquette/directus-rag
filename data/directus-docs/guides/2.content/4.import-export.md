## Import Items

You can import JSON or CSV files into your collection as items.

To import Items from a file, navigate to the collection and click "Import / Export" in the sidebar. Click into the import search box. A file browser will open. Once a file has been selected, click on "Start Import" to import the items.

The items will now be in the collection, and the file itself will not be stored in the Directus project.

The field headers in the imported file must match the field keys of the collection you're importing into. Otherwise, the column will be skipped.

**Importing Relational Files**  
It is possible to import relational field values as well. For this task, the user performing the import will need access
permissions for the related collection.
