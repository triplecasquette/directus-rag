As a developer advocate and freelance coach, I share valuable content with my audience via my [blog](https://thefreelancehq.com/blog). When creating the blog, I needed a [Headless CMS](https://directus.io/solutions/headless-cms) that would integrate nicely with a Next.js Pages directory and make it easy to manage content. Notion was a great choice then, so I opted for it.

While Notion worked pretty well for most cases, the setup process wasnâ€™t quite as easy as I expected, especially the process of mapping Notion elements to DOM elements.

I ran into some challenges and limitations.

1. **Clunky SDK**: Mapping Notion blocks to DOM elements required a lot of custom JS code
2. **Field Relationships UX**: Setting up relationships between page fields was quite cumbersome. For example, I couldn't easily connect blog posts to authors.

## Workaround Solutions Within Notion

Based on the limitations, I had to come up with creative solutions:

- Created a formatDate Function to show the latest publication date of a blog post.

```js
const formatDate = (date: string) => {
  return new Date(date).toLocaleDateString('en-US', {
    year: 'numeric',
    month: 'long',
    day: 'numeric',
  });
};
```

- Created a function to automatically add a slug for each blog entry using the slugify library.
- Created a `formatBlogData` Function to match the Notion blocks to each content type.

```js
export function formatBlogData(page: PageData) {
  const { properties = {}, id, cover } = page;

  const { Summary, Title, Published, Tags } = properties;

  const title = match(Title)
    .with({ type: 'title' }, (field) => field.title[0].plain_text)
    .otherwise(() => 'Untitled');

  const publishedDate = match(Published)
    .with({ type: 'date' }, (field) => field.date.start)
    .otherwise(() => '2023-01-01');

  return {
    id,

    title,

    slug: slugify(title).toLowerCase(),

    tags: match(Tags)
      .with({ type: 'multi_select' }, (field) => field.multi_select)
      .otherwise(() => []),

    coverImage: match(cover)
      .with({ type: 'external' }, (cover) => cover.external.url)
      .with({ type: 'file' }, (cover) => cover.file.url)
      .otherwise(() => ''),

    publishedDate: {
      raw: publishedDate,
      formatted: formatDate(publishedDate),
    },

    summary: match(Summary)
      .with({ type: 'rich_text' }, (field) => field.rich_text[0].plain_text)
      .otherwise(() => 'Placeholder summary'),
  };
}
```

- Built a custom Notion block and text component to achieve the desired appearance for each content type.

These additional components and functions led to codebase complexity, and I soon realized there was a need for an alternative CMS that could offer scalability and maintainability over time.

## Why Directus?

Today I am excited to share my recent adventure of migrating my blog content from Notion to Directusâ€”a headless content management system (CMS). You may wonder, why Directus?

Well, Directus is not just another CMS. It offers a unique combination of flexibility, customization, and collaboration for content management. It also has built-in user roles and permissions and a JavaScript SDK which were core features I was particularly interested in.

ðŸ’¡ If you're new to Directus, create a Directus Cloud account [here](https://directus.cloud/register).

## Creating the Blogs Collection and Data Model

Migrating my blog content to Directus was a smooth process. In my Directus instance, I initally created a `blogs` collection to hold all blog data. Then I went on to design the data model with the following fields:

- `id` - Integer Input
- `status` - Dropdown
- `title` - Input
- `content` - WYSIWIG
- `tags` - Tags
- `authors` - Many to Many relationship
- `image` - Image
- `date_published` - Datetime

Based on the data model created, I transferred the blog content from Notion to Directus.

## Updating the Frontend Code

For seamless integration with Directus, I leveraged the power of the JavaScript SDK.
The first step involved installing it using the command:

```
npm install @directus/sdk
```

Subsequently, I eliminated the Notion-specific helper functions and code that pertained to content block handling. In the `index.js` file, using the Directus SDK, I fetched all blog posts, simplifying data fetching from Directus.

```js
export const getStaticProps = async () => {
  await directus.auth.static(process.env.DIRECTUS_TOKEN);

  const result = await directus.items('blogs').readByQuery({ sort: ['published_date'] });

  const resolvedResult = await Promise.all(
    result.data.map(async (blog) => {
      const author = await directus.items('Authors').readOne(1);
      return { ...blog, author: author?.name };
    })
  );

  resolvedResult?.forEach((blog) => {
    blog.image = `${process.env.DIRECTUS_URL}assets/${blog.image}`;
  });

  return {
    props: {
      blogs: resolvedResult,
    },
  };
};
```

By leveraging the WYSIWYG field in Directus, I could seamlessly handle the content of my blogs without the need for Notion components. Also, I no longer needed to rely on the formatDate function I had developed earlier, as Directus provides built-in sorting capabilities.

## Image Handling

Directus proved to be a game-changer in terms of image handling. In Notion, images are stored as embedded assets. In Directus, images are stored as separate files. Each image in Directus is assigned a unique URL, facilitating seamless integration and effortless management.

## Updating the Dynamic Route

Given that my project was built on Next.js, I made necessary modifications to the code, specifically targeting dynamic route data fetching. I also utilized the blog's ID as a slug for the blogs, eliminating the need for the Slugify library.

Here's the snippet showing the code used:

```js
export const getStaticProps = async (context) => {
  const blogId = context.params?.blogId;
  const directus = new Directus(process.env.DIRECTUS_URL);
  const blog = await directus.items('blogs').readOne(blogId);
  blog.image = `${process.env.DIRECTUS_URL}assets/${blog.image}`;
  return {
    props: { blog },
  };
};
```

## In Summary

With my blog content now securely hosted in Directus, I'm able to utilize more features of Directus and collaborate with other content creators and blog writers. I can:

- Grant roles and permissions to collaborators, empowering them to share and contribute content effortlessly.
- Enjoy live content previews without the need for application redeployment.

This project has been exciting, and I hope you have gleaned insights from this migration.
