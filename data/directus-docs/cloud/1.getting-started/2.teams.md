A team is an organizational system that groups accounts together as team members and provides consolidated billing on its nested projects. Teams within the cloud dashboard allow individuals to separate or combine projects and payment methods, as well as manage projects independently or with other team members.

For example, a company can use teams to organize projects by department, each with consolidated billing and scoped access. Similarly, agencies or freelancers with multiple customers can create a team per client to limit their access and isolate billing. Teams are free, so create as many as you need to appropriately organize team members, projects, and payment methods.

## Create a Team

**Team Name and Team Slug**  
The team name is a text name assigned to a team, used in the cloud dashboard. The team slug lies within the full URL `https://directus.cloud/TEAM-SLUG/projects`. These are purely organizational, allowing you to easily remember the team and link to specific cloud dashboards. They do not impact cloud projects or billing and can be updated at any time.
