When a file is clicked in the file listing page, the file details page is shown. This is a custom form for viewing assets
and embeds, with core fields included out-of-the-box (see below), and the ability for administrators to add additional
custom fields. This page has the same features and functionality as the
item page.

## Action Buttons

Notice the following buttons in the header:

- :icon{name="material-symbols:check-circle"} – Saves any edits made to the file.
- :icon{name="material-symbols:tune"} – Opens the image editor.
- :icon{name="material-symbols:download"} – Downloads the file to your current device.
- :icon{name="material-symbols:drive-file-move-outline"} – Moves selected file(s) to another folder.
- :icon{name="material-symbols:delete-outline"} – Permanently removes the file and its metadata. This action is permanent and cannot be undone.

**Deleting Files Linked to Items**  
By default, Directus will not allow you to delete a file until you remove it from any and all related items. However,
this behavior can be reconfigured so that files automatically update when the image is deleted by setting the relational
constraint of your file field to `SET NULL` or `CASCADE` when the file is deleted.

## File Details

The files collection comes pre-configured with the following fields out of the box. New fields can be created and
customized as needed in **Settings > Data Model** under the `directus_files` collection. However the pre-configured Fields cannot be changed or deleted.

- **Preview**: a preview of the image or file.
- **Title**: a title for the File.
- **Description**: a description of the File.
- **Tags**: keywords used for search-ability.
- **Location**: an optional location _(e.g. where a photo was taken)_.
- **Storage**: which storage adapter is used to store the file asset.
- **Filename (Disk)**: This is the actual name of the file in storage. This cannot be modified.
- **Filename (Download)**: allows you to set the name of the file when it is downloaded.

## File Sidebar

The file sidebar also includes the following details, which are not editable and serve as metadata.

- **Type**: the MIME type of the file, displayed in the App as a formatted media type.
- **Dimensions**: _images only_. The width and height of the image in pixels.
- **Size**: the file-size the asset takes up in the storage adapter.
- **Created**: the timestamp of when the file was uploaded to the Project.
- **Owner**: the User that uploaded the file to the Project.
- **Modified**: the timestamp of when the file was last modified.
- **Edited By**: the User that modified the File.
- **Folder**: the current parent folder that contains the File.
- **Metadata**: metadata JSON dump of the File's Exif, IPTC, and ICC information.
