title: DirectusÂ API Reference
description: Learn how to use our API
---

Each Directus project comes with an integrated RESTful API that adapts as you work on your project.

Authentication is achieved via [access tokens, cookies or sessions](/guides/auth/tokens-cookies).

You can also interact with the API using GraphQL or the [Directus SDK](/guides/connect/sdk).

This API reference is generated from our OpenAPI specification. Found an error? Please open a PR on the [directus/openapi](https://github.com/directus/openapi) repo!

## Dynamic API

The platform's API uses database mirroring to dynamically generate
REST endpoints and a GraphQL schema based on the connected database's architecture. Since these endpoints return data
based on your specific schema and configured permissions, the input/output of the API differs greatly for individual
installations.
