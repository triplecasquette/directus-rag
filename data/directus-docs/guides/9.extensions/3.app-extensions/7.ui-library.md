Directus offers reusable UI components for building extensions, providing a consistent user experience across the Directus Data Studio. These components are used by Directus itself and can be utilized in any extension without explicit imports.

Explore the available components in our [Directus Components Playground](https://components.directus.io/). Here, you can
see all available components and experiment with variations before implementing them in your extensions.

## Extension Usage

Directus UI components are globally registered, making them accessible throughout your extension project without the
need for explicit imports. Hereâ€™s an example:

```html
<VButton>My Button</VButton>
```

## Customizing Styles

Each component exports CSS custom properties (variables) that can be targeted for style overrides.

For example, to adjust the text color of a button on hover:

```vue
<template>
	<!-- give the button a class -->
	<VButton class="my-button">My Button</VButton>
</template>

<style>
/* customize the style */
.my-button {
	--v-button-color-hover: black;
}
</style>
```

## Creating a Custom UI Component

The Directus UI components are designed with flexibility and customization in mind. However, you may need to create your
own components using shared styling. Directus exposes several CSS variables for both light and dark themes.

Examples of CSS variables include `--theme--border-normal`, `--theme--foreground-normal` `--theme--purple`, `--theme--module-background`, and
`--theme--overlay-color`.
