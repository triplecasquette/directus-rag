The visual editor module enables content editors to render their website within the Directus Studio, navigate around within the site, and make edits to content in place.

## Configure Visual Editor URLs

Navigate to Settings -> Visual Editor and add the URL of your website that you want to visually edit within the visual editor module. If you have multiple websites that you wish to edit, then add multiple URLs.

Be sure to enable the Visual Editor from the Modules section of the settings page so it shows up in your project's module bar.

Clicking the :icon{name="material-symbols:edit"} beside an editable element will open an editor in either a drawer, modal, or popover depending on which `mode` was specified in the elements `data-directus` attribute on the frontend.
