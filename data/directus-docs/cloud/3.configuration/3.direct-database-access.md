**Direct Database Access** (Direct DB) is an exclusive feature for Enterprise-tier customers, providing the capability to connect directly to their databases for advanced querying and management.

## Requesting Access

To enable Direct DB access, Enterprise customers need to [submit a support ticket](https://directus.io/support). Once the request is reviewed, the support team will provide the necessary connection details.

## Connecting to Your Database

To connect, use a SQL tool of your choice —such as [DBeaver](https://github.com/dbeaver/dbeaver)— and configure the following connection settings:

- **Host**: The URI where the database service is hosted
- **Port**: The connection port
- **User**: The username with database access permissions
- **Password**: The associated password for the user
- **Database Name**: The name of the database you intend to access

The support team will provide each of these configurations in response to your Direct DB request.
