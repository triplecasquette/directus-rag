The Directus Marketplace provides a way for users to install extensions in their projects directly the Data Studio. It's available in all projects, whether run on Directus Cloud or self-hosted.

## Discover Extensions

The Marketplace is accessible from your project settings. Here, you can search, filter, and sort the available extensions to navigate to the extension detail page where you can install extensions.

**Compatibility Warnings**  
Extension authors must specify which versions the extensions have been tested to work with. If authors don't update this value, we may show an incompatibility warning. This does not mean that an extension does not work, but that the author has not explicitly stated that it does.

## Manage Extensions

The currently-installed extensions list is accessible from your project settings. Here, you can disable or uninstall them. Extensions in [bundles](/guides/extensions/bundles) can be disabled, but only the whole bundle can be uninstalled.

## Publishing Extensions

The Directus Marketplace uses the Directus Extensions Registry to publish and install extensions. While in beta, all extensions published to npm are available via the registry.
