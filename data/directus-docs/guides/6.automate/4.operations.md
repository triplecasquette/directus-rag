description: Operations are individual customizable actions in a flow.
---

Operations are the individual actions in a flow. They enable you to do things like manage data within Directus,
transform the flow's data, send information off to outside services, set conditional logic, trigger other flows, and
more.

## Condition

![Condition operation configuration](/img/be18c61d-1a80-4251-8d33-547943318f6a.webp)

A condition operation lets you choose a success path or failure path by validating data passed into it with
[Filter Rules](/guides/connect/filter-rules).

### Options

- **Condition Rules** — Create conditions with [Filter Rules](/guides/connect/filter-rules).

### Payload

This operation does not generate data. If the filter rule is configured properly, it will append a `null` value on its
`operationKey`, regardless of if the condition was met or not. However, if the filter rule is misconfigured, it will
append an array containing an object you can use to help debug the misconfiguration.

::callout{icon="material-symbols:warning-rounded" color="amber"}
When using an [Event Hook](/guides/automate/triggers) configured to be "Filter (Blocking)", if your flow ends
with a condition that executes with a `reject` path, it will cancel your database transaction.
::

## Run Script

![Run Script operation configuration](/img/85932180-168e-44d6-814d-bb29bf76a713.webp)

This operation lets you add a custom script using vanilla JavaScript or TypeScript. The script will be executed securely
in an isolated sandbox. No interactions take place between the sandbox and the host except for sharing input and output
values. This means, for example, no access to the file system and no ability to do network requests.

### Options

The operation provides a default function template. The optional `data` parameter lets you pass in the data chain as
an argument.

### Payload

The function's `return` value will be appended under its `<operationKey>`.

### More Details

As an example, let's say you have this function in a script operation, named `myScript`.

```json
// A key from the data chain
{
	"previousOperation": {
		"value": 5
	}
}
```

Then you add the following logic via Run Script.

```typescript
// Your function in the myScript operation
module.exports = function (data) {
	return {
		timesTwo: data.previousOperation.value * 2,
	};
};
```

The returned value will be appended under the `myScript` operation key.

```json
{
	"previousOperation": {
		"value": 5
	},
	"myScript": {
		"timesTwo": 10
	}
}
```

::callout{icon="material-symbols:info-outline"}
Make sure your `return` value is valid JSON.
::

::callout{icon="material-symbols:info-outline"}
**Throwing Errors**  
If you throw an error in a Run Script operation, it will immediately break your flow chain and stop execution of
subsequent flows. If you used a ["Blocking" Event hook](/guides/automate/triggers), throwing an error will cancel
the original event transaction to the database.
::

::callout{icon="material-symbols:info-outline"}
**Node Modules**  
To prevent unauthorized access to the underlying server, node modules can't be used in the Run Script operation. If
you require a third party library for your custom script, you can create a custom
[operation extension](/guides/extensions/api-extensions/operations) instead.
