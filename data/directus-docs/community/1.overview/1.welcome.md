What makes Directus so special is our amazing community. All members of our community, regardless of role, must abide by our [code of conduct](/community/overview/conduct).

[You can view our moderation information and guidelines here.](/community/overview/moderation)

## Education

We want everyone to be as successful as possible in understanding what Directus is, the key concepts, how it relates to their problem, and how to successfully implement it.

To learn more about how you can help improve the documentation, check out our page on documentation contribution [link].

## Feature Requests

To learn more about how we use GitHub for feature requests, including how to open a new feature request, the review process and the implementation of accepted feature requests, see the [feature requests page](/community/contribution/feature-requests).

## Code Contributions

The whole Directus project is on GitHub, and community code contributions are always welcome! Fixing issues or implementing new features is an excellent way to contribute back to the platform.

Please do make sure you read through [our pull request process](/community/contribution/pull-requests)  before you start! That ensures you have the highest likelihood that your contribution will make it to the core codebase.

## Online Community

Our online community meets in two places - [Discord](https://directus.chat/) and [GitHub](https://github.com/directus/directus/discussions). GitHub is used for discussing feature requests and bugs, and Discord is used for community discussion and requests for help.

The Directus community is growing quickly, which also means there are more and more people with questions. Helping out your fellow developers by providing answers on [Discord](https://directus.chat/) is a great way to help the project. Questions are opened in one of our help channels, and all are encouraged to respond.

## Sponsorship & Advocacy

Directus requires significant resources to build and maintain, especially as our community rapidly grows. If you'd like to help keep development active, please consider supporting Directus through sponsorship or advocacy.

### Sponsorship

If you would like to help ensure Directus can continue being maintained and improved, please consider providing financial support through [GitHub Sponsors](https://github.com/sponsors/directus) for as little as $1/month. The money we are given from our GitHub sponsors goes straight back to community members who build tooling and extensions for the Directus ecosystem.

### Advocacy

#### GitHub Stars

As an open source project, stars are important to helping more people discover us. It only takes a few seconds to head to the [**Directus GitHub repo**](https://github.com/directus/directus) and click the star. With enough activity in a short period of time, we get *even more exposure* on GitHub's trending page!

#### Social Posts

Engage with us on social media. Follow us! A quick post mentioning [@directus](https://twitter.com/directus) or on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/company/directus-io) goes a long way!

#### Testimonials

**One sentence.** Even that was a sentence and it was only two words! If you're a fan of Directus, we'd love to hear why with a short endorsement... More importantly, potential new users *need to hear your testimonial* to see if the product is right for them! [You can leave a short written or video testimonial now.](https://testimonial.to/directus).
