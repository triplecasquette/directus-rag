You can use these advanced options to automatically set the values of fields at specific events by clicking on "Continue in Advanced Field Creation Mode".

For example, you can set the default value of a [Many-to-One (M2O) relationship](/guides/data-model/relationships) to be the current user.

Below is an example showing a `updated_on` Datetime field on a `posts` collection that is set to the current time upon creation and updating:

![Editing the "Updated On" field in `posts`, showing "On Create" set to "Save Current Date/Time", and "On Update"'s dropdown open](/img/advanced_field_creation_mode.png)

You can also set this mode after the field has been created.
