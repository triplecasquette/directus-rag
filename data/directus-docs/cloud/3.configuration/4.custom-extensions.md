Custom Extensions is an Enterprise-tier feature that lets you deploy custom extensions to your Cloud project, offering more flexibility to tailor your project to your needs. [Learn more about Extensions](/guides/extensions/overview).

## Enabling Custom Extensions

To enable Custom Extensions, Enterprise customers can [submit a support ticket](https://directus.io/support) to request access for their project. 

In the support ticket, please include the GitHub usernames of any users who should have access to the custom extensions. Once enabled, these users will be invited to a repository that includes an example Custom Extension to get started.

## Deploying Custom Extensions

To deploy custom extensions, follow these steps:

1. Create the extension locally: Refer to the guide on [creating extensions](/guides/extensions/quickstart).
2. Build the extension on your local machine.
3. Clone the GitHub repository provided.
4. Copy the `package.json` file and the `dist` folder from your local extension build.
5. Navigate to the cloned repository folder.
6. Enter the project folder within the repository.
7. Create a new folder for the extension inside the project folder, and paste the content copied in step 4.
8. Push the changes to the `main` branch.

Once changes are pushed to `main`, they will go live within 2 to 4 minutes.
